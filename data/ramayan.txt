The Ramayana (/r???m??j?n?/;[1][2] Sanskrit: ????????, romanized: R?m?ya?am[3]), also known as Valmiki Ramayana, as traditionally attributed to Valmiki, is a smriti text (also described as a Sanskrit epic) from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahabharata.[4] The epic narrates the life of Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu, who is a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across the forests in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana; the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, the king of Lanka, that resulted in bloodbath; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya along with Sita to be crowned as a king amidst jubilation and celebration.
Scholarly estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th–5th to 5th–4th century BCE,[5][6] and later stages extend up to the 3rd century CE,[6] although the original date of composition is unknown. It is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature and consists of nearly 24,000 shlokas (verses), divided into seven k???a (chapters). Each shloka is a couplet (two individual lines). The Ramayana belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (pur?v?tta), interspersed with teachings on the goals of human life.
There are many versions of the Ramayana in Indian languages, including Buddhist and Jain adaptations. There are also Cambodian (Reamker), Malay (Hikayat Seri Rama), Filipino, Thai (Ramakien), Lao, Burmese, Nepali, Maldivian, Vietnamese, and Tibeto-Chinese versions of the Ramayana.[a]
The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and the Hindu life and culture, and its main figures were fundamental to the cultural consciousness of a number of nations, both Hindu and Buddhist. Its most important moral influence was the importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in the ideals of the formation of a state (from Sanskrit: ????????, romanized: R?mar?jya, a utopian state where Rama is king) or of a functioning society .
Etymology
The name R?m?ya?a is composed of two words, R?ma and ayana "travel, journey", with the grammatical internal sandhi "joining" of the final short a in R?ma and the initial short a in ayana to the longer form ?.[12] R?ma, the name of the main figure of the epic, has two contextual meanings. In the Atharvaveda, it means "dark-coloured or black" and is related to the word r?tri "the darkness or stillness of night". The other meaning, which can be found in the Mahabharata, is "pleasing, pleasant, charming, lovely, beautiful".[13][14] Thus, R?m?ya?a means "Rama's journey".[15]
Dating
Scholarly estimates of the earliest stage of the available text range from the 7th–5th to 5th–4th centuries BCE,[16][6] with later stages extending to the 3rd century CE.[6] According to Robert P. Goldman (1984), the oldest parts of the Ramayana date to the early 7th century BCE.[17] The core parts, states Goldman, cannot have been composed later than the 6th or 5th century BCE, due to the narrative neither mentioning Buddhism (founded in the 5th century BCE) nor the prominence of Magadha (which rose to prominence in the 7th century BCE). The text also mentions Ayodhya as the capital of Kosala, rather than its later name of Saketa or its successor capital of Shravasti.[18] In terms of narrative time, the action of the Ramayana predates the Mahabharata. Goldman & Sutherland Goldman (2022) consider the Ramayana's oldest surviving version was composed around 500 BCE.[19]
Books two to six are the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Balakanda and Uttara Kanda, respectively) are considered to be later additions. Style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars including Hermann Jacobi toward this consensus.[20]
Genre
The Ramayana belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (pur?v?tta), which includes the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, and the Puranas. The genre also includes teachings on the goals of human life. It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal son, servant, brother, husband, wife, and king.[21] Like the Mahabharata, Ramayana presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in the narrative allegory, interspersing philosophical and ethical elements.[b]
Structure
In its extant form, Valmiki's Ramayana is an epic poem containing over 24,000 couplet verses, divided into seven k???as (B?lak???a, Ayodhyak???a, Ara?yak???a, Ki?kindak???a, Sundar?k???a, Yuddhak???a, Uttarak???a), and about 500 sargas (chapters).[25][26] It is regarded as one of the longest epic poems ever written.[27]
Recensions
The Ramayana text has several regional renderings, recensions, and sub-recensions. Textual scholar Robert P. Goldman differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar Romesh Chunder Dutt writes that "the Ramayana, like the Mahabharata, is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind."
There has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes of Valmiki's Ramayana (Bala Kanda and Uttara Kanda) were composed by the original author. Though Bala Kanda is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many Uttara Kanda is certainly a later interpolation, not attributable to Valmiki.[25] Both of these two k?ndas are absent in the oldest manuscript.[28]
Some think that the Uttara Kanda contradicts how Rama and Dharma are portrayed in the rest of the epic. M. R. Parameswaran says that the way the positions of women and Shudras are depicted shows that the Uttara Kanda is a later insertion.
Since Rama was revered as a dharmatma, his ideas seen in the Ramayana proper cannot be replaced by new ideas as to what dharma is, except by claiming that he himself adopted those new ideas. That is what the U-K [Uttara Kanda] does. It embodies the new ideas in two stories that are usually referred to as Sita-parityaga, the abandonment of Sita (after Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya and Rama was consecrated as king) and Sambuka-vadha, the killing of the ascetic Sambuka. The U-K attributes both actions to Rama, whom people acknowledged to be righteous and as a model to follow. By masquerading as an additional kanda of the Ramayana composed by Valmiki himself, the U-K succeeded, to a considerable extent, in sabotaging the values presented in Valmiki's Ramayana.[29]

Synopsis
B?la K???a
The epic begins with the sage V?lm?ki asking N?rada if there is a righteous man still left in the world, to which N?rada replies that such a man is R?ma. After seeing two birds being shot, V?lm?ki creates a new form of metre called ?loka, in which he is granted the ability to compose an epic poem about R?ma. He teaches his poem to the boys Lava and Ku?a, who recite it throughout the land and eventually at the court of King R?ma. Then the main narrative begins.[30]
Da?aratha was the King of Ayodhy?. He had three wives: Kausaly?, Kaikey?, and Sumitr?. He did not have a son and in the desire to have a legal heir performs a fire sacrifice known as Putr?y? I??i. Meanwhile, the gods are petitioning to Brahm? and Vi?h?u about R?va?a, king of the r?k?asas who is terrorizing the universe. Thus Vi?h?u had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon R?va?a. As a consequence, R?ma was first born to Kausaly?, Bharata was born to Kaikey?, and Lak?ma?a and ?atrughna were born to Sumitr?.[30]
When R?ma was 16 years old, the r??i (sage) Vi?v?mitra comes to the court of Da?aratha seeking help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses R?ma, who is followed by Lak?ma?a, his constant companion throughout the story. R?ma and Lak?ma?a receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vi?v?mitra and proceed to destroy T??ak? and many other demons. Vi?v?mitra also recounts much lore of the landscape, his own ancestors, and the ancestors of the princes.[30]
The party then decides to attend King Janaka's sacrifice in the kingdom of Mithil?, who has a bow that no one has been able to string. Janaka recounts the history of the famed bow, and informs them that whoever strings the bow will win the hand of his daughter S?t?, whom he found in the earth while plowing a field. R?ma then proceeds to not only string the bow, but breaks it in the process. R?ma marries S?t?; the wedding is celebrated with great festivity in Mithil? and the marriage party returns to Ayodhy?.[30]
Ayodhy? K???a
After R?ma and S?t? have been married, an elderly Da?aratha expresses his desire to crown R?ma, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great event, Kaikey? was happy regarding this, but was later on provoked by Manthar?, a wicked maidservant, to claim two boons that Da?aratha had granted to her. Kaikey? demands R?ma to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata.
The grief-stricken king, bound by his word, accedes to Kaikey?'s demands. R?ma accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterizes him throughout the story. He asks S?t? to remain in Ayodhy?, but she convinces him to take her with him into exile. Lak?ma?a also resolves to follow his brother into the forest.
After R?ma's departure, King Da?aratha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata, who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhy?. He is shocked and refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming. He visits R?ma in the forest and implores him to return to Ayodhy? and claim the throne that is rightfully his. But R?ma, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile. Bharata reluctantly returns to Ayodhy? and rules the kingdom on behalf of his brother.[31]
Ara?ya K???a
In exile, R?ma, S?t?, and Lak?ma?a journey southward along the banks of the river God?vari, where they build cottages and live off the land. One day, in the Pañcavati forest they are visited by a r?k?as? named ?urpa?akh?, sister of Rava?a. She tries to seduce the brothers and, after failing, attempts to kill S?t? out of jealousy. Lak?ma?a stops her by cutting off her nose and ears. Hearing of this, her brothers Khara and Dushan organize an attack against the princes. Rama defeats Khara and his rakshasas.
When the news of these events reaches R?va?a, he resolves to destroy R?ma by capturing S?t? with the aid of the rak?asa M?r?ca. M?r?ca, assuming the form of a golden deer, captivates S?t?'s attention. Entranced by the beauty of the deer, S?t? pleads with R?ma to capture it. R?ma, aware that this is the ploy of the demons, cannot dissuade S?t? from her desire and chases the deer into the forest, leaving S?t? under Lak?ma?a's guard.
After some time, S?t? hears R?ma calling out to her; afraid for his life, she insists that Lak?ma?a rush to his aid. Lak?ma?a tries to assure her that R?ma cannot be hurt that easily and that it is best if he continues to follow R?ma's orders to protect her. On the verge of hysterics, S?t? insists that it is not she but R?ma who needs Lak?ma?a's help. He obeys her wish but stipulates that she is not to leave the cottage or entertain any stranger. He then draws a line that no demon could cross and leaves to help R?ma. With the coast finally clear, R?va?a appears in the guise of an ascetic requesting S?t?'s hospitality. Unaware of her guest's plan, S?t? is tricked and is then forcibly carried away by R?va?a.[32]
Jat?yu, a vulture, tries to rescue S?t? but is mortally wounded. In Lank?, S?t? is kept under the guard of rak?as?s. Rava?a asks S?t? to marry him, but she refuses, being totally devoted to R?ma. Meanwhile, R?ma and Lak?ma?a learn about S?t?'s abduction from Jat?yu and immediately set out to save her. During their search, they meet Kabandha and the ascetic ?abar?, who directs them to Sugriva and Hanuman.

Ki?kindh? K??da
Kishkindha Kanda is set in the land of V?naras (Vana-nara) – Forest dwelling humans.[33] R?ma and Lak?ma?a meet Hanum?n, the biggest devotee of R?ma, greatest of ape heroes, and an adherent of Sugriva, the banished pretender to the throne of Ki?kindh?. R?ma befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother V?li thus regaining the kingdom of Ki?kindh?, in exchange for helping R?ma to recover S?t?.
However, Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time enjoying his newly gained power. The clever former ape queen T?r?, (wife of V?li) calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lak?ma?a from destroying the ape citadel. She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honour his pledge. Sugriva then sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success from the north, east, and west. The southern search party under the leadership of A?gada and Hanum?n learns from a vulture named Samp?t? the elder brother of Jat?yu, that S?t? was taken to Lank?.
Sundara K???a
Sundara Kanda forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of Hanum?n's heroics. After learning about S?t?, Hanum?n assumes a gigantic form and makes a colossal leap across the sea to Lanka. On the way, he meets many challenges like facing a Gandharva Kany? who comes in the form of a demon to test his abilities. He encounters a mountain named Main?ka who offers Hanuman assistance and a place to rest. Hanum?n refuses because there is little time remaining to complete the search for S?t?.
After entering Lank?, he finds a demon, Lankini, who protects all of Lank?. Hanum?n fights her and subjugates her in order to get into Lank?. In the process, Lankini, who had an earlier a vision or warning from the gods, therefore, knows that Lank?'s end is near if someone defeats Lankini. Here, Hanum?n explores the demons' kingdom and spies on R?va?a. He locates S?t? in the Ashoka grove, where she is being wooed and threatened by R?va?a and his rakshasis to marry him.
Hanum?n reassures S?t?, giving R?ma's signet ring as a sign that R?ma is still alive. He offers to carry S?t? back to R?ma; however, she refuses and says that it is not the dharma, stating that Ram?ya?a will not have significance if Hanum?n carries her to R?ma – "When R?ma was not there R?va?a carried S?t? forcibly and when R?va?a was not there, Hanum?n carried S?t? back to R?ma." She says that R?ma himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction. She gives Hanum?n her comb as a token to prove that she is still alive.
Hanum?n takes leave of S?t?. Before going back to R?ma and telling him about S?t?'s location and desire to be rescued only by him, he decides to wreak havoc in Lank? by destroying trees in the Naulakha Bagh and buildings and killing R?va?a's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and delivered to R?va?a. He gives a bold lecture to R?va?a urging him to release S?ta. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and leaps across the rooftops, sets fire to R?va?a's citadel, and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Ki?kindh? with the news.
Yuddha K???a
Also known as Lank? K???a, this book describes the war between the army of R?ma and the army of R?va?a. Having received Hanuman's report on S?t?, R?ma and Lak?ma?a proceed with their allies towards the shore of the southern sea. There they are joined by R?va?a's renegade brother Vibhi?a?a. The v?naras named Nala and N?la construct the Rama Setu.[34]
The princes and their army cross over to Lanka. A lengthy war ensues. During a battle, Ravana's son Meghan?da hurls a powerful weapon at Lak?ma?a and he gets mortally wounded. So Hanum?n assumes his gigantic form and flies from Lank? to the Himalayas. Upon reaching, Hanum?n is unable to identify the sanjeevani herb that will cure Lak?ma?a and so he decides to bring the entire mountain back to Lank?. Eventually, the war ends when R?ma kills R?va?a. R?ma then installs Vibhisha?a on the throne of Lanka.
On meeting S?t?, R?ma says; "The dishonour meted out to him and the wrong done to her by R?va?a have been wiped off, by his victory over the enemy with the assistance of Hanum?n, Sugr?va and Vibhisha?a".[35] However, upon criticism from people in his kingdom about the chastity of S?t?, R?ma gets extremely disheartened. So S?t?, in order to prove the citizens wrong and wipe the false blame on her, requests R?ma and Lak?ma?a to prepare a pyre for her to enter. When Lak?ma?a prepares the pyre, S?t? prays to Agni and enters into it, in order to prove her conjugal fidelity. Agni appears in person from the burning pyre, carrying S?t? in his arms and restores her to R?ma, testifying to her purity.[36] Rama later joyfully accepts her. The episode of Agni Pariksha varies in the versions of Ram?ya?a by Valmiki and Tulsidas. In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, S?t? was under the protection of Agni (see M?y? S?t?) so it was necessary to bring her out before reuniting with R?ma. The gods led by Brahma arrive and glorify Rama as the incarnation of Supreme God Narayana. Indra restores the dead Vanaras back to life.
After the exile, R?ma returns to Ayodhya and the people are so happy they celebrate it like a festival. Deepavali is the day considered that R?ma, S?t?, Lak?ma?a and Hanum?n reached Ayodhy? after a period of 14 years in exile after R?ma's army of good defeated demon king R?va?a's army of evil. The return of R?ma to Ayodhy? was celebrated with his coronation. It is called R?ma pattabhisheka. There are mentions in R?maya?a that Rama gave several donations to Sugriva, Jambavan, other Vanaras, and gave a pearl necklace to Sita telling her to give it to a great person. She gives it to Hanum?n. R?ma was so thankful to Vibhisa?a and wanted to give him a great gift. R?ma gave his Aradhana Devata (Sri Ranganathaswamy) to Vibhishana as a gift.[37][better source needed] Rama's rule itself was R?ma r?jya described to be a just and fair rule.[38] It is believed by many that when Rama returned people celebrated their happiness with diyas, and the festival of Deepavali is connected with R?ma's return.[39][better source needed]
Uttara Kanda
Scholars note "linguistic and rhetorical differences" between the Uttara Kanda and books 2 through 6 of the Ramayana, especially in stories such as Sita's exile and the death of Shambuka, and together with Bala Kanda[40] it is considered by some scholars to be an interpolation, and that "the 'original' poem ended with the Yuddhakanda.[41]
This kanda narrates Rama's reign in Ayodhya, the birth of Lava and Kusha, the Ashvamedha yajna, and the last days of Rama. At the expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman, where the coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign is called Rama-Rajya (a place where the common folk are happy, fulfilled, and satisfied). Then Valmiki trained Lava and Kusha in archery and succeeded to the throne after Rama.
Versions
As in many oral epics, multiple versions of the Ramayana survive. In particular, the Ramayana related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in south India and the rest of southeast Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on Ramayana in Indonesia, Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Maldives.
India
There are diverse regional versions of the Ramayana written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. A West Bengal manuscript from the 6th century presents the epic without two of its kandas.
During the 12th century, Kamban wrote Ramavataram, known popularly as Kambaramayanam in Tamil, but references to Ramayana story appear in Tamil literature as early as 3rd century CE. The Telugu rendition, Ranganatha Ramayanam, was written by Gona Budda Reddy in the 13th century and another of a purer Telugu rendition, called Molla Ramayanam written by Atukuri Molla in the 15th century.
The earliest translation to a regional Indo-Aryan language is the 14th-15th century Saptakanda Ramayana in Assamese by Madhava Kandali. Valmiki's Ramayana inspired Sri Ramacharit Manas by Tulsidas in 1576, an epic in Awadhi Hindi with a slant more grounded in a different realm of Hindu literature, that of bhakti; it is an acknowledged masterpiece, popularly known as Tulsi-krita Ramayana. Gujarati poet Premanand wrote a version of the Ramayana in the 17th century.[citation needed] Akbar, the third Mughal Emperor, commissioned a simplified text of the Ramayana which he dedicated to his mother, Hamida Banu Begum. Created around 1594, the manuscript is illustrated with scenes from the narrative.[42][43]
Other versions include Krittivasi Ramayan, a Bengali version by 14th century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha in the early 15th century; Vilanka Ramayana by 15th century poet Sarala Dasa[44] and Jagamohana Ramayana (also known as Dandi Ramayana) by 15th century poet Balarama Dasa, both in Odia; a Torave Ramayana in Kannada by 16th-century poet Narahari; Adhyathmaramayanam, a Malayalam version by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan in the 16th century; in Marathi by Sridhara in the 18th century; in Maithili by Chanda Jha in the 19th century; and in the 20th century, Rashtrakavi Kuvempu's Sri Ramayana Darshanam in Kannada and Srimadramayana Kalpavrukshamu in Telugu by Viswanatha Satyanarayana who received Jnanapeeth award for this work.
There is a sub-plot to the Ramayana, prevalent in some parts of India, relating the adventures of Ahiravan and Mahi Ravana, evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-Mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a cave, to be sacrificed to the goddess Kali. Adbhuta Ramayana is a version that is obscure but also attributed to Valmiki – intended as a supplementary to the original Valmiki Ramayana. In this variant of the narrative, Sita is accorded far more prominence, such as elaboration of the events surrounding her birth – in this case to Ravana's wife, Mandodari as well as her conquest of Ravana's older brother in the Mahakali form.
The Gondi people have their own version of the Ramayana known as the Gond Ramayani, derived from oral folk legends. It consists of seven stories with Lakshmana as the protagonist, set after the main events of the Ramayana, where he finds a bride.[45]
In Adiya Ramayana, an oral version of Ramayana prevailing among the Adiya tribe of Wayanad, Sita is an Adiya woman hailing from Pulpally in Wayanad.[46] A notable difference in the version is that the Rama, Lakshmana and Hanuman were tied to a tree and were brought to trial in the tribal court, where the deities of the clan Sidhappan, Nanjappan, Mathappan etc. interrogate them with intense inquiries regarding the ethical justification for abandoning his pregnant wife in the barren jungle, neglecting his duties as a husband. Rama admits his mistakes and reaccepts Sita, Lava and Kusha.[46][47]
Vijayadashami
Vijayadashami is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Durga Puja and Navaratri.
